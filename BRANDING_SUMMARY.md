## Implementation Details

### Core CSS Variables

Brand colors and typography have been defined as CSS variables in a central `brand.css` file, which is imported into the global stylesheet. This ensures consistent usage across the entire site.

### Tailwind Configuration

The Tailwind configuration has been extended to include all brand colors and typography, making them available through utility classes:

- Brand colors are available as `bg-brand-green`, `text-brand-gold`, etc.
- Typography is available through `font-primary`, `font-secondary`, and `font-accent` classes

### Component-Level Styling

Components have been updated to use the brand colors and typography consistently, ensuring a unified look and feel across the website.

### Hardcoded Hex Values Replaced

All hardcoded hex color values have been replaced with brand color variables, ensuring consistent usage across the codebase. This includes:

- UI components like buttons, inputs, and checkboxes
- Decorative elements like borders, backgrounds, and icons
- Text elements including headings, paragraphs, and links

### Placeholder Images

Placeholder images have been created for all header sections, to be replaced with final imagery that aligns with the brand photography style guide.

## Next Steps

1. **Photography**: Replace placeholder images with professional photography that follows the brand photography style guide
2. **Content Review**: Ensure all content aligns with the brand messaging framework
3. **User Testing**: Validate the implementation with user testing to ensure the brand experience is consistent and effective
