Change campaign (second), IUPAC (third) (we can make each of this collaboration area a
static page so I can write a short note about the project/collaboration )
Publications: Authors should be O. A. et al. (not O.R. et al)
Things to remove – Research impact and collaboration

4. Blog: Under category, create a category for diary

5. Trusted sellers: Whatsapp link, phone no and facebook (or instagram) link. Customer’s

6. The Market Watch page:
on mobile, "current marketprice section" when you click on "All State" dropdown the box is not properly positioned, therefore you cannot see the list of the state.
we do not have this issue on desktop, only on mobile
